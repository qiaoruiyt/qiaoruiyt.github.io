I am a PhD student in machine learning at National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by Assoc Prof [Bryan Low Kian Hsiang](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html) and supported by AI Singapore (AISG) PhD Fellowship. My research interest includes distribution shifts, causal inference, and natural language processing.

Before joining NUS, I was a research assistant in [STATNLP](https://statnlp-research.github.io/) group at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), advised by Assoc Prof [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei/).
