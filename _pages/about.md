I am a PhD student in machine learning at National University of Singapore (NUS), advised by Prof [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html) and supported by AI Singapore (AISG) PhD Fellowship. My research interests include machine learning generalization (distribution shift, data-centric AI, interpretability, causality) and natural language processing. 

Before joining NUS, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) and was a research assistant in [STATNLP](https://statnlp-research.github.io/) group, advised by Prof [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei/).
