I am currently a postdoctoral associate at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), advised by [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/index.html) (NUS) and [Daniela Rus](https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/daniela-rus) (MIT). My research interests include data-efficient post-training (e.g., reinforcement learning) and retrieval-augmented generation for LLM reasoning. 

I completed my PhD in Computer Science in the School of Computing at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Bryan Kian Hsiang Low](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/index.html) and supported by the [AI Singapore PhD Fellowship](https://aisingapore.org/research/phd-fellowship-programme/). 
My thesis focuses on reliable and trustworthy machine learning using data-centric approaches, such as data reweighting, data attribution, and data valuation. 

I was fortunate to be a visiting scholar in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), advised by [Pang Wei Koh](https://koh.pw/).

I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Singapore University of Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) and was a research assistant in the [STATNLP](https://statnlp-research.github.io/) group, advised by [Lu Wei](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei/).
